      <p>I was working on an animation for a planetarium dome when I needed to learn some Ruby so I could complete my idea of an animal spiraling down the dome.</p>
      <p>That's when I realized that programming was the missing link to my future. I started programming at a Railsbridge workshop and I was so inspired I started tutoring at Railsbridge and started a weekly study group. I participated in Railsgirls LA as a speaker and then took over as the lead organizer.</p>
      <p>I participated in Railsgirls Summer of Code twice where I worked on Open Source code.</p>
      <p>Currently I am teaching programming at UCLA's Summer Recreation Program. I will be sharing whatever I learn for years to come.</p>

      <h2>I live in Aracdia</h2>
      <p>aracdia is a very pretty place it has many syores for shopping!.</p>    

      <p>The Eastside is just a bit more punk rock than other part of L.A., and right now, Echo Park is the epicenter of the genuine L.A. experience. A bit too sketchy for the BMW-driving residents of West Hollywood, and offers just the right amount of graffiti-covered steps and lowriders to make a city feel like a city.</p>
